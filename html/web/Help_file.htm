        <span class="style4"><span class="style5">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span></p>      <ol>
        <li class="style3">Simply drop the movieclip named &quot;gallery_mc&quot; on to your stage , all code is self-contained in this movieclip. Make sure you place it's x and y co-ordinates to 0 on the stage. If you need a gradient background which adjusts to screen size also drop the movieclip &quot;bg_mc&quot; on to your stage.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li class="style3">To customize your gallery, first create the thumbnail and large images and save them to a folder. Once you have created your images then you will need to add them to the XML file. In the XML file you can set the folder name for each gallery, the title for each gallery, the file names for thumbs and large images, the caption and the copy.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li class="style3">To change settings in the flash file see INITIAL VARS in the script, you can set many variables such as the maximum amount of thumbs to be displayed, spacing for  thumbs, tween speed etc. See comments in the code for more details. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li class="style3"> The copy which appears when you rollover an image supports HTML formatting so you can add html hyperlinks. See example in XML, also see comments in the code to customise hyperlink colour and style.<br>
<br>
